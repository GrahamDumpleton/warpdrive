The ``warpdrive`` project provides scripts for implementing a build and
deployment system for Python web applications. It targets local
development, as well as deployment directly to a managed host, a Docker
hosting service, a more comprehensive container application platform, or
a platform as a service (PaaS) provider.

In short, ``warpdrive`` aims to make working on and deploying Python web
applications easy. It does this by managing for you the tasks of building
up everything required to deploy your application, including Docker images,
and then also managing the startup of your Python web application. Builtin
support is provided for the most popular Python WSGI servers, with hooking
mechanisms to allow you to also make use of custom Python web servers,
including ASYNC based web servers or frameworks.
