This is a S2I builder for creating Docker images for Python web applications.

To use the builder, first install S2I from:

    https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

You can then create a Docker image from a GIT repository by running:

    s2i build git://<source code> $BUILDER_NAME <application image>

The resulting image can then be run as:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 <application image>

The S2I builder is also compatible with the builtin support of OpenShift 3
for deploying applications using S2I.
